# Contribution

This library is in its simplest form because it was built in a short time and has many improvements that need to be made.
If you have never contributed or want to help improve it, feel free to help solve the [issues](https://github.com/isaqueveras/venustre/issues).

We need to create implementations of the interfaces that this library uses for different contexts, such as observability of the data from these routines.

I started a small frontend application to monitor routines, I don't have much time to dedicate to the development of the frontend application. If you want to contribute to continue developing this application, you can find it [in this repository](https://github.com/isaqueveras/venustre-monitor).
