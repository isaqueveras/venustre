features:
  - icon: ü¶ö
    title: It's a library (it's very customizable)
    details: This is not an executable, this is a library that you import and use, so you just write the code and it does exactly what you want. You can create your own implementation of the methods that the library needs to work, so you have the freedom to control all the executions of the routines.
  - icon: ü¶Ñ
    title: Just start using it
    details: Create and control groups of routines with just a few lines of code, use the watcher.Go() method that accepts several types of options that define the configuration of the routine (script), such as defining the id, name, description and the function that will be executed at the defined interval.
  - icon: üêé
    title: Statistics and Events
    details: With your own implementation of the core interface, you can control the execution of routines and have control over how you want to use the data generated by the routines, exporting it to Grafana or other data visualization tools. Use indicators and histograms within routines.
